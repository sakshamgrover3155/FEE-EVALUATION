                    <h2>LION</h2>
                    <p>
                        The lion is a large, powerful carnivorous mammal belonging to 
                        the cat family, Felidae. Known as the "king of the jungle," lions are native to 
                        Africa and parts of Asia. They have short, tawny fur, with male lions distinguished 
                        by their majestic manes. Lions are social animals, living in groups called prides, 
                        which usually consist of females, cubs, and a few males. They primarily hunt large 
                        herbivores like zebras, buffalo, and antelope. Lions are known for their strength, 
                        speed, and roar.

                    <p>
                        Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth, belonging to the family 
                        Elephantidae. They are known for their massive bodies, long trunks, large ears,
                         and tusks made of ivory. Elephants use their trunks for various tasks like 
                         breathing, grasping objects, and drinking water. They are herbivores, feeding 
                         on grass, leaves, fruit. Elephants are highly social animals, living 
                         in groups called herds. Found in Africa and Asia, 
                         elephants play a key role in their ecosystems but are threatened by poaching and 
                         habitat destruction.

                    <h2>BEAR</h2>
                    <p>
                        Bears are large, powerful mammals belonging to the family Ursidae. 
                        They are found in North America, Europe, Asia, and parts of South America. 
                        Bears have thick fur, strong limbs, and sharp claws, which help them climb, 
                        dig, and hunt. Most species are omnivorous, eating a wide variety of foods such as
                         plants, berries, fish, and small mammals. Some species, like the polar bear, are 
                         more carnivorous, while the panda feeds mostly on bamboo. Bears hibernate during 
                         winter and are known for their solitary nature.

                    <p>
                        The tiger is the largest species of wild cat, known for its striking orange 
                        coat with black stripes. Tigers are solitary and territorial animals found mainly 
                        in Asia, from dense forests to grasslands and swamps. They are powerful predators 
                        that rely on stealth and strength to hunt prey such as deer, wild boar, and buffalo
                        . Tigers are excellent swimmers and can cover large distances in search of food. 
                        Sadly, they are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.

                    <p>
                        The wolf is a large, carnivorous mammal that belongs to the dog 
                        family, Canidae. Known for their intelligence and pack behavior, wolves live and 
                        hunt in groups, often taking down prey like deer, elk, and smaller mammals. They 
                        have thick fur, which helps them survive in various habitats, from forests to 
                        tundras. Wolves communicate using vocalizations like howls, as well as body 
                        language and scent marking. Native to North America, Europe, and Asia, wolves are 
                        apex predators and play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance.
