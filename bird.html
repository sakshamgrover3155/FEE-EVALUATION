                        The ostrich (Struthio camelus) is the largest and heaviest living bird, native to Africa. Known for its impressive size, an adult ostrich can reach up to 9 feet tall and weigh between 220 to 330 pounds. Despite its large size, it is a flightless bird with powerful legs adapted for running at speeds of up to 45 miles per hour. Ostriches have long necks and legs, which help them spot predators from afar. They lay the largest eggs of any bird species and are primarily herbivorous, feeding on seeds, shrubs, and grasses.
